Trivia Server

This server was created for the IBM On Demand Community. It was developed using Bluemix® to run on a Swift server. It also makes use of a Cloudant® database and the IBM Watson™ Language Translator. It was created in support of the Talking Trivia Activity Kit which provides an introduction to iOS mobile app development.
